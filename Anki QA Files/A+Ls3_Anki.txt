Single Channel memory indicates what characteristic about a system?; a single, 64bit bus between memory and the cpu
Dual Channel memory [controller] indicates what characteristic about a system?; there are two (logical) 64 bit pathways between each of the two memory channels and the cpu<br>*or 128 bits can be accessesed per 'transaction'
To enable dual channel memory usage, how must the memory DIMM's be installed?;-with each DIMM in socket one of each channel (usually channel pairs are marked)
What two conditions may cause a dual channel motherboard to operate in single channel memory mode?-adding an odd number of DIMM's<br><br>-adding mismatched DIMM's
What is parity checking?;the examination of the parity bit (ninth bit after the 8 bits that make a byte) to ensure that the value is the same as before
Most desktop PC's have what type of memory?;non parity
Workstations, servers and high reliability machines will use what type of memory?;Error Checking and Correcting (ECC) memory
Beyond the checking a correction of single bit errors, what will ECC do with additional errors?;detect and generate an error message, halt system
ECC has what type of memory bus?;72 bit bus
What else may ECC require to be used?;-enabling is system setup<br><br>-mother board support *Mandatory
What is one way of improving a PC's performance with original parts?;*if supported, enabling dual channel memory
True of False: Different speeds of memory can be mixed in PC.; True (but not preferred; not optimal performance)
If an ECC memory DIMM is used what must be also used?;-only other memory DIMM's that are ECC

What are some basic advantages of SSD's?;-more efficient, less prone to failure<br>-better read/seek times<br>*Main disadvantage: cost
What restriction will be encountered if a platter hard drive is directly replaced with an SSD?;6Gbps transfer rate<br>-due to the use of SATA Advanced Host Controller Interface (AHCI)
How can the transfer bottle neck of SSD's be corrected?;use of a PCIe connected SSD<br>*uses the:<br>Non-Volatile Memory Host Controller Interface Specification (NVMHCI)
