On Red Hat linux what is the system initialization script?;rc.sysinst<br>[located at] /etc/rc.sysinit
On Debian based systems what is the system initialization script?;rcS<br>[located at] /etc/init.d/rcS
System services are also known as...;daemons<br>*which typically run in the background
What directory of scripts can be used to manage running daemons by allowing you to standardize the commands that are used to control them?;/etc/init.d
What is Runlevel 0?;Shutdown-A special transitional state used by administrators to shut down the system quickly.<br><br>-Shut down system.<br>-a server in this default runlevel whould shut down once the kernel launches the init process *IE machine won't come up
What is Runlevel 1, Runlevel s, Runlevel S?;Single User mode-*They are all the same; different systems may use either number letter<br><br>Single User Mode<br>-system services network-interface, web-servers, and file-sharing are not started in Single User Mode/Maintenance Mode
What is Runlevel 2?;---->On Debian systems:<br>-default run level<br><br>---->On RedHat:<br>-multiuser mode, minus NFS filesharing & X Window
What is Runlevel 3?;---->On Debian systems:<br>-not typically used<br><br>---->On RedHat:<br>-default multi-user mode, minus X Window
What is Runlevel 4?;*Typically unused (RHEL & Debian)
What is Runlevel 5?;---->On Debian systems:<br>-not typically used<br><br>---->On RedHat:<br>full multi-user mode with X Window/GUI<br>-X 11 (remote SSH session capability)<br>*Should X11 not function correctly, avoid runlevel 5
What is Runlevel 6?;Reboot-A special transitional state used by admins<br>*should not be default runlevel. A system with this set as the default runlevel would continously reboot
True or False: Runlevels themselves are completely configurable (customizeable).;True
True or False: GRUB allows you to pass arbitrary parameters to a kernel at boot time.;True
Upon booting, the init process initiates what script first in RHEL and Debian systems (two answers/files)?;RHEL: /etc/rc.sysinit<br>/etc/init.d/rcS<br>*the rcS script runs several smaller scripts in two directories; accomplishes the same job
What is /etc/rc.local ?;the script called after all other init scripts/daemons are started<br>*contains local customizations that are NOT lost in an upgrade<br><br>**rc.local may not exist on all distributions
On RHEL, what script is used to change between run levels?;/etc/rc
Where are scripts to startup/shutdown all services on the system?;/etc/init.d
What two arguments do all service scripts in /etc/init.d accept?; start<br> stop
What arguments beside start & stop might a service script in /etc/init.d might be accepted?; restart<br> status<br> reload
While all system initialization scripts are located in /etc/init.d the init Process does not call these scripts directly; it uses ________ located in directories ________.;soft links to the scripts .....  /etc/rc0.d - /etc/rc6.d [all 7 runlevel directories]
A file S12syslog is located in the active runlevel directory; what can be known about this file; -the syslog service is to be started [S]<br><br>-it is the 12th service started when the machine enters this runlevel
Where is the default run level set?;/etc/inittab <br>*in a file such as id:N[runlevel]:initdefault:
What two runlevels can not be set to the default runlevel?;0 or 6
What command can be used to see the current runlevel?;runlevel <br>*will return the current and previous runlevel (or N if it has just finished booting)
What command may be used to change the runlevel of a machine?;init [runlevel]
What command uses a link to change the runlevel?;telinit [runlevel]
By default the shutdown command first changes the runlevel to...;single user mode
shutdown -f now    does what?;fast boot<br>*skips filesystem checks on next boot
shutdown -j now    does what?;halts system after shutdown
shutdown -k now    does what?;ONLY sends warning messages for shutdown
shutdown -r now    does what?;reboot after shutdown
shutdown -F now    does what?;force file check on next boot
On a system with limited or legacy storage size (1G), what number and types of partitions could you use to accomodate this storage limitation?;3 partitions:<br>/boot<br>/ (...root)<br>swap
What partition in a linux filesystem will most likely be the largest partition?;/home<br>*used for user directories and data
To access a filesystem/partition, what must first be done?;mount the drive/partition<br>*add them to a filesystem table
Where do you mount a filesystem?;mount point<br>*directory
This contains information such as type, size, and status of a filesystem?;superblock<br>*linux equivalent to Microsoft's File Allocation Table (FAT)
What is the MBR?;Master Boot Record<br>-512bytes in size, located in first sector of HDD<br><br>*contains info about partitions and loads operating system
What is needed to boot from a USB device?;-atleast one partition on the USB with bootable flag set<br><br>an MBR must write to the primary partition of the USB device<br>-image must be 'burned' to the device (Ubuntu Live USB creator)
What are some advantages of having a USB bootable drive?;-portable image of OS, personal files/applications<br>-can be used to boot machines that have an issue booting by themselves
