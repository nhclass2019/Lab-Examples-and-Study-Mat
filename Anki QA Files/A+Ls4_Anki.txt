What is the first step in the basic function of a CPU?;control unit retrieves instruction from memory to pipeline
What is the second step in the basic function of a CPU?;control unit decodes each instruction and either:<br>-executes<br>-passes instruction to Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)<br>or<br>-passes instruction to Floating Point Unit (FPU)
What is the third step in the basic function of a CPU?;result of executed instruction is written back to register or system memory
What instruction set(s) are Intel?;x86-32, IA-32<br>x86-64, x64<br>*Intel had a 64 bit instruction set circa 2001 called, IA-64 (Itanium CPU's)
What instruction set is AMD?;AMD64
What memory restrictions exist with 32 bit architecture?;4 Gb [RAM] is addressable (usable)
What memory restrictions exit with 64 bit cpu architecture?;theoretical - 16 exabytes<br>in actuality - restricted to 48 bit memory address: 256 Terabytes<br>*restriction intended to reduce backward compatibility with 32 bit software<br><br>*32 bit architectures sometimes include a 36 bit bus for addressing up to 64GB of memory
This is a small block of high speed memory that enhances performance by pre-loading code and data from a relatively slow memory and passing it to the CPU...;Cache
What is BIOS?;Basic Input Output System, firmware for the CPU
When a CPU bus is 'double pumped' or 'quad pumped', what does this mean?;-that there are two or four transfers per clock cycle<br><br>-memory architecture is probably multi channel (2,3,4 pc-memory paths)
What is the general difference between L1, L2, L3, & L4 caches?;L1 - fastest temporary memory access to CPU<br>-succesive caches (L2, L3...) are larger, farther away from the CPU and slower
What are two types of CPU multitasking?;-superpipelining*gradually increased but declined due to innefficiency<br><br>Multithreading - aka Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT) or Hyperthreading [Hyperthreading Teechnology HTT with Intel]
What is a CPU thread?;stream of instructions generated by software/programming<br>-software that generates multiple streams of instructions is 'multithreaded'.<br><br>-functionally Threads duplicate many CPU registers, to the OS - multiple CPU's
A general problem for a typical desktop computer with respect to multithreading is...;most desktop software doesn't used multithreading because it (mutithreaded software) is more complex to design.
What is core clock speed?;the speed at which the CPU runs internal processes and accesses L1/L2 Cache (L2 Cache speed depends on the CPU arch.)
How is overclocking accomplished and what is it used for?;-CPU clock speed is altered with system setup firmware programs<br><br>-used for hobbyist/game enthusiasts & cost effective use of cheaper components with enhanced performance
What is SMP?;symetric multiprocessing: a condition where two or more physical CPU's share a common OS and memory executes instructions simultaneously
What is throttling?;technology that allows the CPU to slow down if temperature is too hot or save energy
What are four virtualization features found on CPU's?;-Hardware assisted virtualization<br>-SLAT [second level address translation]: virtualization software designed to improve virtual (or paged) memory<br>-EPT [extended page table]: term used by for SLAT exensions by Intel<br>-RVI [rapid virtualization indexing]: term used for SLAT extensions by AMD
What is LGA?;Land Grid Array: Intel technology in which pins that connect the CPU and socket are located on the socket (motherboard)
What is PGA?;Pin Grid Array: AMD technology in which pins that connect the CPU and socket are located on the underside of the processor
What is ZIF?;Zero Insertion Force: a processor socket type allowing the chip to be placed in the socket with as little chance of damaging the pins as possible
What is passive cooling?; cooling systems that work without electricity
What are three typical cooling mechanisms in computers?;-CPU heatsink/fan assembly<br>-Case fans<br>-GPU fans
Liquid cooling uses what two typical parts (besides pump)?;Heat pipe (using oil, water, ethanol coolant) & Heat spreader (flat pipe for coolant heat dispersement)
Fans with a 3 pin cable model function by....;varying voltage to the fan
Fans with a 4 pin cable model function by...;switching voltage on & off (using a Pulse Width Module)
A+;pg 172
Before upgrading a CPU what should you first consider?; whether the new CPU will outperform the currently installed CPU
After confirming a CPU upgrade is beneficial, what other issues might be considered?;-Viewing the type of CPU [currently installed] in System Properties<br><br>-use a utility, such as CPUID CPU-Z, to determine architecture & other information<br><br>-use a CPU manufacturers website to determine if the CPU is compatible with the motherboard
A specialized software stored in memory chips that store information whether or not power to the computer is on....;Firmware
What is BIOS?;industry standard program code that initialized the essential components of the PC and ensures the design of the motherboard is compatible
